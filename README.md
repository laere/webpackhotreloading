<h1>Simple starter template with Hot Reloading</h1>

This is a basic webpack with hot reloading template. **It also has redux-thunk, redu-xpromise middleware, react-router/react-redux-router/redux built into the store** and ready to go!

Just clone the repo and ```npm start``` and go to ```localhost:8080``` and start hacking!
